<p>When several individuals of the same species or of several different species depend on the same limited resource, a situation may arise that is referred to as competition. The existence of competition has been long known to naturalists; its effects were described by Darwin in considerable detail. Competition among individuals of the same species (intraspecies competition), one of the major mechanisms of natural selection, is the concern of evolutionary biology. Competition among the individuals of different species (interspecies competition) is a major concern of ecology. <img alt="⭐️" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2b50.svg" title=":star:" /><u>It is one of the factors controlling the size of competing populations, and extreme cases it may lead to the <strong>extinction</strong> of one of the competing species.【B】</u> This was described by Darwin for <mark>indigenous New Zealand species of animals and plants</mark>, which dies out when <strong>competing</strong> species from Europe were introduced. </p>

<p>TPO 25 The Surface of Mars (正确率 96.70%) </p>
<p>The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct consequence of the planet’s low surface gravity. As lava flows and spreads to form a shield volcano, the volcano’s eventual height depends on the new mountain’s ability to support its own weight. <img alt="⭐️" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2b50.svg" title=":star:" /><u>The lower the gravity, the lesser the weight and the greater the height of the mountain</u>. It is no accident that <mark>Maxwell Mons on Venus and the Hawaiian shield volcanoes on Earth</mark> rise to about the same height (about 10 kilometers) above their respective bases-<u>Earth and Venus have similar surface gravity.</u> Mars’s surface gravity is only 40 percent that of Earth, so volcanoes rise roughly 2.5 times as high. Are the Martian shield volcanoes still active? Scientists have no direct evidence for recent or ongoing eruptions, but if these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago (an estimate of the time of last eruption based on the extent of impact catering on their slopes), some of them may still be at least intermittently active. Millions of years, though, may pass between eruptions. </p>

<p>TPO 29 Competition (正确率 96.11%) </p>
<p>No serious competition exists when the major needed resources is in superabundant supply, as in most cases of the coexistence of herbivores (plant eaters). Furthermore, most species do not depend entirely on a single resource, if the major resource for a species becomes scarce, the species can usually shift to alternative resources. If more than one species is competing for a scarce resource, the competing species usually switch to different alternative resources. Competition is usually most severe among close relatives with similar demands on the environment. But it may also occur among totally unrelated forms that compete for the same resource, such as seed-eating rodents and ants. The effects of such competition are graphically demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an ecosystem come into competition, as happened 2 million years ago at the end of the Pliocene, when <mark>North South America became joined by the Isthmus of Panama</mark>. <mark>North and South American</mark> species migrating across the Isthmus now came into competition with each other. <img alt="⭐️" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2b50.svg" title=":star:" /><u>The result was the <strong>extermination</strong> of a large fraction of the South American mammals, which were apparently <strong>unable</strong> to withstand the competition from invading North American species--although added predation was <strong>also</strong> an important factor.</u> </p>

<p>TPO 13 Biological Clocks (正确率 95.73%) </p>
<p>Survival and successful reproduction usually require the activities of animals to be coordinated with predictable events around them. Consequently, the timing and rhythms of biological functions must closely match periodic events like the solar day, the tides, the lunar cycle, and the seasons. The relations between animal activity and these periods, particularly for the daily rhythms, have been of such interest and importance that a huge amount of work has been done on them and the special research field of chronobiology has emerged. Normally, the constantly changing levels of an animal's activity—sleeping, feeding, moving, reproducing, metabolizing, and producing enzymes and hormones, for example—are well coordinated with environmental rhythms, but the key question is whether the animal's schedule is driven by external cues, such as sunrise or sunset, or is instead dependent somehow on internal timers that themselves generate the observed biological rhythms. Almost universally, biologists accept the idea that all eukaryotes (a category that includes most organisms except bacteria and certain algae) have internal clocks. <img alt="⭐️" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2b50.svg" title=":star:" /><u>By isolating organisms completely from external periodic cues, biologists learned that organisms have internal clocks【B】</u>. <strong>For instance</strong>, apparently normal daily periods of biological activity were maintained for about a week by <mark>the fungus Neurospora</mark> when it was intentionally isolated from all geophysical timing cues while orbiting in a space shuttle. The continuation of biological rhythms in an organism without external cues attests to its having an internal clock. </p>

<p>TPO 11 Begging by Nestlings (正确率55.58%) </p>
<p>As these experiments show, begging apparently provides a signal of need that parents use to make judgments about which offspring can benefit most from a feeding. But the question arises, why don't nestlings beg loudly when they aren't all that hungry? By doing so, they could possibly secure more food, which should result in more rapid growth or larger size, either of which is advantageous. <img alt="⭐️" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2b50.svg" title=":star:" /><u>The answer lies <strong>apparently not</strong> in the increased energy costs of exaggerated begging—<mark>such energy costs are small relative to the potential gain in calories</mark>— but rather in the <strong>damage</strong> that any successful cheater would do to its siblings, which share genes with one another.</u> An individual's success in propagating his or her genes can be affected by more than just his or her own personal reproductive success. Because close relatives have many of the same genes, animals that harm their close relatives may in effect be destroying some of their own genes. Therefore, a begging nestling that secures food at the expense of its siblings might actually leave behind fewer copies of its genes overall than it might otherwise. </p>

<p>When crayfish are kept continuously in the dark, even for four to five months, their compound eyes continue to adjust on a daily schedule for daytime and nighttime vision. Horseshoe crabs kept in the dark continuously for a year were found to maintain a persistent rhythm of brain activity that similarly adapts their eyes on a daily schedule for bright or for weak light. <u>Like <strong>almost</strong> all daily cycles of animals <strong>deprived of</strong> environmental cues, those measured for the horseshoe crabs in these conditions were <strong>not exactly</strong> 24 hours. Such a rhythm whose period is <strong>approximately</strong>—but not exactly—a day is called circadian</u>. <mark>For different individual horseshoe crabs, the circadian period ranged from 22.2 to 25.5 hours</mark>. A particular animal typically maintains its own characteristic cycle duration with great precision for many days. Indeed, stability of the biological clock's period is one of its major features, even when the organism's environment is subjected to considerable changes in factors, such as temperature, that would be expected to affect biological activity strongly. Further evidence for persistent internal rhythms appears when the usual external cycles are shifted—either experimentally or by rapid eastwest travel over great distances. Typically, the animal's daily internally generated cycle of activity continues without change. As a result, its activities are shifted relative to the external cycle of the new environment. The disorienting effects of this mismatch between external time cues and internal schedules may persist, like our jet lag, for several days or weeks until certain cues such as the daylight/darkness cycle reset the organism's clock to synchronize with the daily rhythm of the new environment. </p>

<p>When one considers the many ways by which organisms are completely destroyed after death, it is remarkable that fossils are as common as they are. Attack by scavengers and bacteria, chemical decay, and destruction by erosion and other geologic agencies make the odds against preservation very high. However, the chances of escaping complete destruction are vastly improved if the organism happens to have a mineralized skeleton and dies in a place where it can be quickly buried by sediment. <u><strong>Both</strong> of these conditions are often found on the <strong>ocean floors</strong></u>, where shelled invertebrates (organisms without spines) flourish and are covered by the continuous rain of sedimentary particles.

<p>In the 1970s when the study of Australian archaeology was in an exciting phase of development, with the great antiquity of rock art becoming clear. Lesley Maynard, the archaeologist who coined the phrase “Panaramitee style,” suggested that a sequence could be determined for Australian rock art, in which a geometric style gave way to a simple figurative style (outlines of figures and animals), followed by a range of complex figurative styles that, unlike the pan-Australian geometric tradition tended to much greater regional diversity. While accepting that this sequence fits the archaeological profile of those sites, which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years a number of writers have warned that the underlying assumption of such a sequence—a development from the simple and the geometric to the complex and naturalistic—obscures the cultural continuities in Aboriginal Australia, in which geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important. <u>In this context the simplicity of a geometric motif may be more apparent than real.
