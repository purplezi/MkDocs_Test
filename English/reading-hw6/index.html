<p>TPO 14 Children and Advertising (正确率 97.08%) </p>
<p>Fantasy is one of the more common techniques in advertising that could possibly mislead a young audience. Child-oriented advertisements are more likely to include magic and fantasy than advertisements aimed at adults. In a content analysis of Canadian television, the author Stephen Kline observed that nearly all commercials for character toys featured fantasy play. Children have strong imaginations and the use of fantasy brings their ideas to life, but children may not be adept enough to realize that what they are viewing is unreal. Fantasy situations and settings are frequently used to attract children's attention, particularly in food advertising. Advertisements for breakfast cereals have, for many years, been found to be especially fond of fantasy techniques, with almost nine out of ten including such content. <img alt="⭐️" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2b50.svg" title=":star:" /><u>Generally, there is uncertainty as to whether very young children can <strong>distinguish</strong> between fantasy and reality in advertising.</u> Certainly, rational appeals in advertising aimed at children are limited, as most advertisements use emotional and indirect appeals to psychological states or associations. </p>

<p>Sociologists have built on the distinction between expressive and instrumental ties to distinguish between two types of groups: primary and secondary. A primary group involves two or more people who enjoy a direct, intimate, cohesive relationship with one another. Expressive ties predominate in primary groups; we view the people as ends in themselves and valuable in their own right. A secondary group entails two or more people who are involved in an impersonal relationship and have come together for a specific, practical purpose. 
Instrumental ties predominate in secondary groups; we perceive people as means to ends rather than as ends in their own right. <u>Sometimes primary group relationships evolve out of secondary group relationships.</u> This happens in many work settings. People on the job often develop close relationships with coworkers as they come to share gripes, jokes, gossip, and satisfactions. </p>

<p>TPO 8 The Rise of Teotihuacán (正确率 91.76%) </p>
<p>How did this tremendous development take place, and why did it happen in the Teotihuacán Valley? Among the main factors are Teotihuacán’s geographic location on a natural trade route to the south and east of the Valley of Mexico, the obsidian resources in the Teotihuacán Valley itself, and <u>the valley’s potential for extensive irrigation【D】</u>. The exact role of other factors is much more difficult to pinpoint―for instance, Teotihuacán’s religious significance as a shrine, the historical situation in and around the Valley of Mexico toward the end of the first millennium B.C., the ingenuity and foresightedness of Teotihuacán’s elite, and, finally, the impact of natural disasters, such as the volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B.C. This last factor is at least circumstantially implicated in Teotihuacán’s rise. Prior to 200 B.C., a number of relatively small centers coexisted in and near the Valley of Mexico.<u> Around this time, the largest of these centers, Cuicuilco, was seriously affected by a volcanic eruption</u>, with much of its agricultural land covered by lava. With Cuicuilco eliminated as a potential rival, any one of a number of relatively modest towns might have emerged as a leading economic and political power in Central Mexico. The archaeological evidence clearly indicates, though, that <u>Teotiluacan was the center that did arise as the predominant force in the area by the first century A.D. </u></p>

<p>In the 1980s, John Graves studied two populations of closely related fishes, one population from the Atlantic side of isthmus, the other from the Pacific side. He compared four enzymes found in the muscles of each population. <u>Graves found that all four Pacific enzymes function <strong>better</strong> at lower temperatures than the four Atlantic versions of the same enzymes. This is significant because Pacific seawater if typically 2 to 3 degrees <strong>cooler</strong> than seawater on the Atlantic side of isthmus.【A】</u> Analysis by gel electrophoresis revealed slight differences in amino acid sequence of the enzymes of two of the four pairs. This is significant because the amino acid sequence of an enzyme is determined by genes. </p>
<p>Graves drew two conclusions from these observations. <u>First, at least some of the observed differences between the enzymes of the Atlantic and Pacific fish populations were not random but were the result of evolutionary adaptation.

<p>Further evidence for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging calls of warbler species that nest on the ground versus those that nest in the relative safety of trees. <u>The young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of <strong>higher frequencies</strong> than do their tree-nesting relatives.【D】 These higher-frequency sounds do <strong>not travel as far</strong>【B】, and so may <strong>better conceal</strong> the individuals producing them【C】, who are especially vulnerable to predators in their ground nests.</u> David Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting warblers. The eggs “advertised” by the tree-nesters' begging calls were found bitten significantly more often than the eggs associated with the ground-nesters’ calls. </p>

<p>Even the kind of stability defined as simple lack of change is not always associated with maximum diversity. <u>At least in temperate zones【C】</u>, <u>maximum diversity is often found in mid- successional stages【D】</u>, not in the climax community. <img alt="⭐️" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2b50.svg" title=":star:" /><u>Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of species and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are <strong>reduced</strong>.【B】</u> In general, diversity, by itself, does not ensure stability. Mathematical models of ecosystems likewise suggest that diversity does not guarantee ecosystem stability—just the opposite, in fact. A more complicated system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to break down. (A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child’s tricycle.)</p>

<p>With question such as these clearly before them, the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger processed to the Mediterranean to search for the answers. On August 23, 1970, they recovered a sample. The sample consisted of pebbles of gypsum and fragments of volcanic rock. Not a single pebble was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby continent. In the days following, samples of solid gypsum were repeatedly brought on deck as drilling operations penetrated the seafloor. Furthermore, the gypsum was found to possess peculiarities of composition and structure that suggested <u>it had formed on desert flats【D】</u>. <u>Sediment above and below the gypsum layer contained tiny marine fossils【A】, indicating open- ocean conditions【B】.</u> <u>As they drilled into the central and deepest part of the Mediterranean basin, the scientists took solid, shiny, crystalline salt from the core barrel【C】</u>. Interbedded with the salt were thin layers of what appeared to be windblown silt. </p>
<p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 3 about <mark>the solid gypsum layer</mark>? </p>
<p>A.  It did not contain any marine fossil. </p>

<p>When experimental populations are set up under simple laboratory conditions, the predator often exterminates its prey and then becomes extinct itself, having nothing left to eat. However, if safe areas like those prey animals have in the wild are provided, the prey population drops to low levels but not to extinction. Low prey population levels then provide inadequate food for the predators, causing the predator population to decrease. When this occurs, the prey population can rebound. <u>In this situation the predator and prey populations may continue in this cyclical pattern for some time. 【B】</u></p>
<p><u>Population cycles are <strong>characteristic</strong> of small mammals, and they sometimes appear to be brought about by predators. </u> Ecologists studying hare populations have found that <u>the North American snow shoe hare follows a roughly ten-year cycle【C】</u>. Its numbers fall tenfold to thirty in a typical cycle, and a hundredfold change can occur. Two factors appear to be generating the cycle: food plants and predators.</p>

<p>At times, it is actually possible to watch the effects of natural selection in host-parasite relationships. For example, Australia during the 1940 s was overrun by hundreds of millions of European rabbits. The rabbits destroyed huge expanses of Australia and threatened the sheep and cattle industries. In 1950, myxoma virus, a parasite that affects rabbits, was deliberately introduced into Australia to control the rabbit population. Spread rapidly by mosquitoes, the virus devastated the rabbit population. The virus was less deadly to the offspring of surviving rabbits, however, and it caused less and less harm over the years. Apparently, genotypes (the genetic make-up of an organism) in the rabbit population were selected that were better able to resist the parasite. <u>Meanwhile, the deadliest strains of the virus perished with their hosts as natural selection favored strains that could infect hosts but not kill them.【D】</u> Thus, natural selection stabilized this host-parasite relationship. </p>

<p>A.  Human intervention may alter the host, the parasite and the relationship between them.</p>
<p>B.  The risks of introducing outside organisms into a biological community are not worth the benefits.</p>
<p>C.  Humans should not interfere in host-parasite relationships.</p>
<p>D.  Organisms that survive a parasitic attack do so in spite of the natural selection process. </p>

<p>TPO 6 Infantile Amnesia (正确率27.5%) </p>
<p>Three other explanations seem more promising. One involves physiological changes relevant to memory. Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain continues throughout early childhood, and this part of the brain may be critical for remembering particular episodes in ways that can be retrieved later. <u>Demonstrations of infants’ and toddlers’ long-term memory have involved their repeating motor activities that they had seen or done earlier【B】</u>, such as reaching in the dark for objects, putting a bottle in a doll’s mouth, or pulling apart two pieces of a toy. <u>The brain’s level of physiological maturation may support these types of memories, but not ones requiring explicit verbal descriptions.【D】</u></p>
<p><img alt="❔" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2754.svg" title=":grey_question:" /> What does paragraph 3 suggest about <mark>long-term memory in children</mark>? </p>
<p>A.  Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain is important for the long-term memory of motor activities but <strong>not</strong> verbal descriptions.</p>
<p>B.  Young children may form long-term memories of actions they see earlier than of things they hear or are told. </p>
<p>C.  Young children have better long-term recall of <strong>short</strong> verbal exchanges than of long ones. </p>
<p>D.  Children’s long-term recall of motor activities <strong>increases</strong> when such activities are accompanied by explicit verbal descriptions </p>
