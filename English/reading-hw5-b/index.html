<p>The problem in shipping extended to the Arsenale, Venice’s huge and powerful shipyard. Timber ran short, and it was necessary to procure it from father and father away. In ancient Roman times, the Italian peninsula had great forest of fir preferred for warships, but scarcity was apparent as early as the early fourteenth century. Arsenale officers first brought timber from the foothills of the Alps, then from north toward Trieste, and finally from across the Adriatic.

<p>Why were these hundreds of thousands of settlers—most of them farmers, some of them artisans—drawn away from the cleared fields and established cities and villages of the East? Certain characteristics of American society help to explain this remarkable migration. The European ancestors of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to the same village or piece of land until some religious, political, or economic crisis uprooted them and drove them across the Atlantic. Many of those who experienced this sharp break thereafter lacked the ties that had bound them and their ancestors to a single place. Moreover, European society was relatively stratified; occupation and social status were inherited. In American society, <strong>however</strong>, the class structure was less rigid; <u>some people changed occupations easily【A / C】 and believed it was their duty to improve their social and economic position【B】</u>. As a result, many Americans were an inveterately restless, rootless, and ambitious people. Therefore, these social traits helped to produce the nomadic and daring settlers who kept pushing westward beyond the fringes of settlement. <u>In addition, there were other immigrants who migrated west in search of new homes, material success, and better lives</u>. </p>

<p>The army also provided a means of personal advancement for auxiliary soldiers recruited from the native peoples, as a man obtained hereditary Roman citizenship on retirement after service in an auxiliary regiment. Such units recruited on an ad hoc (as needed) basis from the area in which they were stationed, and there was evidently large-scale recruitment within Britain. The total numbers were at least 12,500 men up| to the reign of the emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117-138), with a peak around A.D. 80. Although a small proportion of the total population, this perhaps had a massive local impact when a large proportion of the young men were removed from an area. Newly raised regiments were normally transferred to another province from whence it was unlikely that individual recruits would ever return. Most units raised in Britain went elsewhere on the European continent, although one is recorded in Morocco. The reverse process brought young men to Britain, where many continued to live after their 20 to 25 years of since, and this added to the cosmopolitan Roman character of the frontier population. <u>By the later Roman period</u><img alt="⭐️" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/2b50.svg" title=":star:" />, <u>frontier garrisons (groups of soldiers) were only <strong>rarely</strong> transferred【C】</u>, since in <u>units became effectively <strong>hereditary</strong>【A】</u>, and <u>forts were <strong>no longer populated</strong>【B】 or maintained at full strength</u>.</p>

When parents talk with children about “what we did today” or “last week” or “last year”, they guide the children’s formation of a framework for talking about the past. They also provide children with reminders about the memory and relay the message that <u>memories are valued as part of the cultural experience.【D】</u> It is interesting to note that some studies show Caucasian American children have earlier childhood memories that Korean children do. Furthermore, other studies show that Caucasian American mother-child pairs talk about past events three times more often than do Korean mother-child pairs. Thus, the types of social experiences children have do factor into the development of autobiographical memories. </p>

<p>TPO 34 Protection of Plants by Insects (正确率 53%) </p>
<p>Extrafloral nectaries at the base of each sepal attract several kinds of insects, but 96 percent of them are ants, several different species of them. When buds are still small, less than a quarter of an inch long, the sepal nectaries are already present and producing nectar. They continue to do so as the flower develops and while the fruit matures. Observations leave little doubt that ants protect morning glory flowers and fruits from the combined enemy force of grasshoppers, caterpillars, and seed beetles. Bentley compares the seed production of six plants that grew where there were no ants with that of seventeen plants that were occupied by ants. Unprotected plants bore only 45 seeds per plant, but plants occupied by ants bore 211 seeds per plant. <u>Although ants are not big enough to kill or seriously injure grasshoppers, they drive them away by nipping at their feet.【A】</u> Seed beetles are more vulnerable because they are much smaller than grasshoppers. <u>The ants prey on the adult beetles【B】</u>, <u>disturb females as they lay their eggs on developing fruits【D】</u>, and <u>eat many of the eggs they do manage to lay【C】</u>. </p>

<p>Some scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what <u>mission specialists think may be a delta【A / B】―a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands.</u> Other researchers go even further, suggesting that the data provide evidence for <u>large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface【D】</u>. A computer- generated view of the Martian North Polar Region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas Basin, which measures some 3,000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin’s rim, is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea. </p>

<p>Outflow channels are probably relics of catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago. <u>They appear only in equatorial regions【B】</u> and generally do not form extensive interconnected networks. Instead, they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains. <u>The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop-shaped “islands” (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide)【C】</u> that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels. Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly enormous―perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon River. Flooding shaped the outflow channels approximately 3 billion years ago, <u>about the same times as the northern volcanic plains formed.【A】</u> </p>

<p>We all know that many more people today are right-handed than left-handed. Can one trace this same pattern far back in prehistory? Much of the evidence about right-hand versus left- hand dominance comes from stencils and prints found in rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere, and in many Ice Age caves in France, Spain, and Tasmania. When a left hand has been stenciled, this implies that the artist was right-handed, and vice versa. Even though the paint was often sprayed on by mouth, one can assume that the dominant hand assisted in the operation. One also has to make the assumption that hands were stenciled palm downward— <u>a left hand stenciled palm upward might of course look as if it were a right hand【B】</u>. Of 158 stencils in the French cave of Gargas, 136 have been identified as left, and only 22 as right; right- handedness was therefore heavily predominant. </p>
<p>Cave art furnishes other types of evidence of this phenomenon. Most engravings, for example, <u>are best lit from the left【A】</u>, as befits the work of right-handed artists, who generally prefer to have the light source on the left so that the shadow of their hand does not fall on the tip of the engraving tool or brush. <u>In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something, it is mostly, though not always, in the right【D】 hand</u>. </p>

<p>Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to strict rules of portability. If you are constantly on the move, you cannot afford to accumulate large material surpluses. Such rules limit variations in accumulated material goods between pastoralist households (though they may also encourage a taste for portable goods of high value such as silks or jewelry). So, by and large, nomadism implies a high degree of self-sufficiency and inhibits the appearance of an extensive division of labor. <u>Inequalities of wealth and rank certainly exist, and have <strong>probably</strong> existed in most pastoralist societies【A】</u>, but <u><strong>except</strong> in periods of military conquest【B】, they are normally <strong>too slight to</strong> generate the stable, hereditary hierarchies that are usually implied by the use of the term class【D】</u>. Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they seem to have been softened by the absence of steep hierarchies of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women acquire most of the skills of men, including, often, their military skills. </p>
